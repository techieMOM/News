Notes :

1. I have followed MVVM Architecture here and wrote few test cases

2. I have made API calls with URLSession normal call with querystring i have done.Didn't write any network layers as single API call is there.
3. In First Screen Label is not aligned with image in Design i aligned it in my app.
4. In Resources folder added custom font used in design.
5. BaseVC used to reuse the overlay functionality.
6. Search functionality works when user taps search button only. When user clears the text it loads the list from "Wired" source.
7. Details Screen designed but Description was limited from the API and tags were not coming so i have used dummy text of Title.
8. NavigationViewController i have used to match the design we can customise the header of Details Controller as we required.
